# Document Templates Reference

Reusable templates for common technical documents. Each includes purpose, audience, standard sections, writing tips, and a fill-in skeleton.

---

## 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Purpose:** Define what to build and why, aligning stakeholders on scope, goals, and success criteria before development begins.

**Audience:** Product managers, engineers, designers, QA, leadership.

**Tips:**
- Lead with the problem, not the solution
- User stories should be testable — write acceptance criteria as concrete scenarios
- Quantify success metrics with baselines and targets
- Keep scope tight; link to separate docs for deep dives

### Skeleton

```markdown

## 2. Request For Comments (RFC)

**Purpose:** Propose a significant technical change, gather feedback from peers, and reach consensus before implementation.

**Audience:** Engineering team, architect leads, affected stakeholders.

**Tips:**
- Present alternatives honestly — show why the proposed approach wins
- Include a "non-goals" section to prevent scope creep in discussion
- Set a review deadline to avoid indefinite open RFCs
- Number your RFCs for easy reference

### Skeleton

### API / Interface Changes
```
[code or schema changes]
```

**Audience:** Current and future engineers, architects, tech leads.

**Tips:**
- Keep each ADR focused on one decision
- Write in present tense at the time of the decision
- Never delete ADRs — supersede them with new ones
- Store ADRs close to the code (e.g., `docs/adr/`)

### Skeleton

```markdown
# ADR-[NNN]: [Decision Title]

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-[NNN]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders:** [Names or roles]

- Define error handling explicitly — do not leave it implicit
- Specify data formats (JSON schemas, DB columns) precisely
- Call out what is *not* changing
