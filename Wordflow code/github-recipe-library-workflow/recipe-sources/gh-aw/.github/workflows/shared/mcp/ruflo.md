<!--
Ruflo MCP shared configuration for GitHub Agentic Workflows.

Why stdio instead of Docker:
- Ruflo's published setup guidance centers on `npx ruflo@latest mcp start`
- No official GHCR/Docker image for the MCP server was identified from upstream docs

Runtime requirements:
- Node.js 20+ (the generated workflow currently runs on Node.js 24)
- Network access to npm (`node` ecosystem) for first-run package resolution

Selected allowlist:
- memory_search / memory_store for bounded memory usage
- swarm_init / swarm_status for swarm lifecycle
- agent_spawn / agent_list for role coordination
- task_orchestrate / task_status for work routing and monitoring

Usage:
  imports:
    - shared/mcp/ruflo.md
